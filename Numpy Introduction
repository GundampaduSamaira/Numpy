NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that’s widely used in science and engineering. 
The NumPy library contains multidimensional array data structures, such as the homogeneous, N-dimensional ndarray, 
and a large library of functions that operate efficiently on these data structures. 

Difference Between Pandas and Numpy
Pandas:
  Purpose: Data Analysis and Data Manipulation
  Main DataStructures are: Series(1D) and DataFrame(2D)
  Type of Data: Works with Numbers, Text, Dates, Categories, etc.,
  Best Used for: Data cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, handling tabular data
  Speed: Slightly slower (built on top of Numpy)
  Missing Values Handling: Strong support (NaN Handling)
  indexing: Label-based + Position-based
  File Handling: can read and write CSV, EXCEL, SQL, JSON

Numpy: 
  Purpose: Numerical Computing
  Main DataStructures are: ndarray(multi-dimensional array)
  Type of Data: Best works with numbers only
  Best Used for: Mathematical operations, linear algebra, arrays, matrices
  Speed: Very fast for numerical operations
  Missing Values Handling: Weak support
  indexing: Position-based
  File Handling: No direct support for CSV, Excel

--> Numpy is designed using c, c++ and python

Numpy Vs Python

Python

--> A general-purpose programming language.
--> Can build anything: apps, websites, games, automation, AI, etc.
--> Comes with built-in data types like lists, tuples, dictionaries.
--> Slower for numerical calculations.
--> Not optimized for working with large datasets or performing heavy math.

Numpy

--> A Python library (not a language).
--> Specially designed for fast numerical computation.
--> Provides the ndarray, which is much faster than Python lists.
--> Supports vectorized operations, linear algebra, matrices, random numbers, etc.
--> Backbone of libraries like Pandas, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn.

Why numpy array are Faster
1. Numpy array store the elements in continuous memory location.
2. Numpy array approximately 50x faster then the python list
3. Numpy array are good at working with multiprocessors

Python List Vs Numpy Array

1. Data Type
  NumPy Array:
      All elements must be of the same data type (int, float, etc.) → homogeneous
  Python List:
      Can store different data types in the same list → heterogeneous
2. Speed
  NumPy Arrays: Very fast (written in C, optimized).
  Python Lists: Slower for numerical operations.
3. Memory Usage
  NumPy Arrays: Use less memory.
  Python Lists: Use more memory.
4. Mathematical Operations
  NumPy Array: Supports vectorized operations (element-wise math directly).
  Python List: Must use loops.
5. Multi-Dimensional Support
  NumPy Array: Supports 2D, 3D, ND arrays (matrix, tensor).
  Python List:
      2D lists are possible but complicated and slower.
